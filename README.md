# french-news-corpus
Create a French news corpus mainly using python.

## Basic workflow
The files are labeled by number in the order I executed them.

You will need to change the filepaths in the scripts to get them to function properly.

The Golang script comes from [SHDavies](https://github.com/SHDavies/) and can be found [here](https://github.com/SHDavies/webscraper/blob/master/main.go).
